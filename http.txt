See what is a http 

In real world example , http is nothing but a hospital , where which we doctors can use to showcase or expose our worth , I am not a doctor btw . So when we write a code , we use http as a hospital to expose our code s end result to the world . 


Now what is express , its the builder of the hospital , we can build http with anything we want , we can use springboot or something else , but for now express is what we gonna be using . 


Now same goes for node js , node js is just like another builder that we gonna be using for building our js code , and running it properly 


When we create app . Get or like express app , we just create a room inside the big hospital  , that is what happening in the code , in that room the docs do different things , in one room maybe it is blood test , and in the other one maybe orthopaedic , this is the meaning of the codebases ,this doc might be able to do different things and expertises in many fields:  the example is below - 

app. get("/", function (req, res) {
const n # req. query.n;
const ans = calculateSum(n)
res. send (ans) ;


app.listen(3000) , the number of the room , the room number will help the patients that is the audience to get into the code , or reach the doctors 


Or maybe the hospital has two or more docs , rooms are 3000 and 3001 
These are called ports 


High level , express is used to create http server 



Docs are single threaded , just like js , they can deal with one at one time , there is no scene of multitasking 


When you have created the http Server but has not done anything , that is no work or no additional code has been written , it will show cannot get , that means the doc is ready but no operations have been done by him right now inside the room , the cabin where he sits 

The / handler has nothing for now 

The / is the route 

What is route , it basically  means that whatever is after the / 


When I am asking the server , like I wrote n=3 after the / , it is supposed to be get request 

If I want to put a new data in the backend , this is post 

If I need to update a data then it is put 

And If I want to delete something from the sever then it is delete request 

Status codes
1. 200 - Everything went fine
2. 404 - Doctor is not in the hospital
3. 500 - Mid surgery light went away
4. 411 - Inputs were incorrect, wrong person came to surgery
5. 403 => you are banned in the hospital 

// creating a http server 
// we are using express
// is express node default library => no , that is it does not come bundled with node js 

const exp = require("constants");
const express = require("express");
//two lines i always have to write 

const app = express();


// req and res => they stand for request and response  
app.get("/" , function(req,res){
    
})

app.listen(3000)




// this three lines are quite enough for you to say that the http server is created


The http topic is eating my heads neurons , I have no fucking idea , how will I do all those questions , those are really tough 
Fuck man
